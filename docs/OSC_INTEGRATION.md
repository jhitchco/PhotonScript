# OSC (one-shot-color) integration — pipeline + calibration

Covers the 600 mm piggyback rig (AP26CC, IMX571 RGGB, 1.29"/px). Companion to the
mono RC16 SHO pipeline. Light epoch: **120 s, gain 100, offset 256, 0 °C**.

## 1. PixInsight pipeline (clean stars)
Files in `deploy/` (+ one Python helper):
- `photonscript/image_processor/osc_cull.py`: **runs first** (called by
  `run-integration-osc.ps1`). Rejects **split-pointing subs** (the mount moved
  mid-exposure, so the sub holds the field twice) and **duplicate subs** (same
  `DATE-OBS`, identical bytes, e.g. `_1` copies); flags sky-background outliers
  (twilight/moon) without moving them unless `-RejectBright`. Rejects are
  **moved** to `<stage>\REJECTED\<reason>\`, never deleted. Writes
  `cull_report.csv` and `reference.txt` (sharpest kept sub). Needs Python + numpy.
- `integrate_osc.js`: PJSR: **clears its own intermediates** (cal/cc/debayer/
  reg/ln) -> (bias/dark/flat if staged) -> ImageCalibration -> CosmeticCorrection
  (CFA, only with a master dark) -> Debayer RGGB (VNG) -> **StarAlignment with
  `distortionCorrection = true`** (reference = `reference.txt`, else mid-stack)
  -> **LocalNormalization** (falls back to additive+scaling on any failure) ->
  PSF-Signal-weighted `ImageIntegration` (WinsorizedSigmaClip) ->
  `masterOSC.xisf` + `masterOSC_review.jpg` (**unlinked** per-channel stretch).
  Every stage asserts it did not output more frames than it was given.
  (No SubframeSelector: its scripted dll access-violates on this PI build.)
- `prepare-integration-osc.ps1`: stage OSC lights + `INSTRUME=AP26CC`, epoch-matched
  calibration into `Staging/<name>/{LIGHTS/OSC,DARKS,BIAS,FLATS/OSC}`.
- `run-integration-osc.ps1`: cull, fill the staging path into the script, launch
  PixInsight. `-CullDryRun` = report only and stop; `-NoCull` = skip the cull.

Run on the desktop:
```
.\deploy\prepare-integration-osc.ps1 -Name "M31_OSC"
.\deploy\run-integration-osc.ps1     -Name "M31_OSC" -CullDryRun   # optional preview
.\deploy\run-integration-osc.ps1     -Name "M31_OSC"
```
It runs **uncalibrated** if no OSC masters are staged (still debayers, distortion-registers,
and integrates): so you get clean stars now, and full calibration once the frames below exist.

### 1a. Lesson: M31_OSC2 (2026-09-21 subs, integrated 2026-09-25)
The master showed **two M31 cores** (one with a black hole punched in it). Two
separate faults:
1. **Split-pointing subs.** The RC16 moved the mount between two pointings ~51'
   apart every few minutes while Piggy-600 kept exposing. 31/62 subs straddled a
   move (ground truth: M31 flux measured at both pointings in every sub). Stars
   of the minority copy are sigma-rejected, but its galaxy light survives. The
   cull detects these from the sub's own autocorrelation (extra peak at the slew
   vector, over the session's static star-field baseline): 0 misclassified.
2. **Stale intermediates.** The script listed whole output folders, so `_cc_d`
   files from an earlier (cosmetic-corrected, no dark) run were stacked alongside
   the new `_d` files: 63 subs went in as 125, and CosmeticCorrection's hole in
   the M31 core came along. Now cleared per run + funnel assertions.
Follow-up (2026-09-26, all 92 library subs as M31_OSC3): some subs sat
almost entirely on the OTHER pointing (M31 centered). Judged against the
majority field's sidelobe baseline they read as "split". The cull now first
groups subs by which field they saw (autocorrelation similarity), judges each
group against its own baseline, integrates only group 0 (the majority
framing) and moves clean subs from other framings to
`REJECTED\other_pointing_<n>\` so they can be stacked separately.
Also found: `0282.fits` and `0282_1.fits` identical (duplicate), and 0282 is a
twilight sub after a 44-min gap (+20% background).

## 1b. Finishing (master -> final image)
`deploy/run-finish-osc.ps1 -Name "M31_OSC2"` runs `finish_osc.js` on
`out\master\masterOSC.xisf`: crop 1.5% registration edges -> gradient removal
(GradientCorrection, else ABE degree 1; `-Gradient none` to skip) -> plate solve
with PixInsight's ImageSolver, seeded from `-Target`/`-RaDeg -DecDeg` (guessed
from the name, e.g. M31) and spiralling out to ~1.2 deg because Piggy-600 frames
rarely center on the target -> SPCC (fallback BackgroundNeutralization +
ColorCalibration when unsolved) -> BlurXTerminator / NoiseXTerminator if
installed (`-NoRC` to skip) -> linked stretch + gentle saturation. Output in
`out\final\`: `<Name>_linear.xisf` (color-calibrated, for manual work),
`<Name>_final.xisf`, `_final.tif` (16-bit) and `_final.jpg`. Log:
`out\finish.log`. Every optional step logs and skips on failure.

## 2. Calibration capture — already built into the sequencer
No new code needed; the machinery matches the light epoch via `rig_config(PIGGYBACK)`
(gain 100 / offset 256 / 0 °C / `dark_exposures="120"`). Three ways to get it:

- **Automatically on arm** — `_dispatch_piggyback_companion` (armer.py) sends NINA #2 a
  companion that shoots OSC **dawn flats always**, and roof-closed **darks + a bias top-up
  when NINA #2 can see the shared safety monitor**. Requires `PS_PIGGYBACK_ENABLED` and
  `PS_PIGGYBACK_CALIBRATE_ON_ARM`. If NINA #2 doesn't have the safety monitor in its
  profile, it's **dawn-flats-only** — add the shared safety monitor to the NINA #2 profile
  to unlock roof-closed darks/bias.
- **On demand (any closed-roof night)** — dispatch a matched OSC dark/bias set to NINA #2:
  ```
  POST /api/calibration/capture   {"rig":"piggyback"}          # 120 s x quota + 50 bias
  POST /api/calibration/capture   {"rig":"piggyback","darks":[[120,30]],"bias":50}
  ```
- **Flats on demand** — `POST /api/calibration/flats {"rig":"piggyback"}` (dusk) / the
  companion's dawn set. OSC flats need no filter wheel (`_osc_sky_flat`).

What you need banked (per the light epoch):
- **Darks:** 120 s, gain 100, offset 256, 0 °C — ~20–30.
- **Flats:** through the 600 mm with the AP26CC, RGGB, ~50 % ADU — ~20–30.
- **Bias** (or flat-darks): gain 100, offset 256, 0 °C — ~50.

`GET /api/calibration/health?rig=piggyback` reports what's banked and staleness.

## 3. One thing to verify (why no OSC calibration matched yet)
The M31 lights currently sit in `Library/_/OSC/` (target folder `_`), but the piggyback
calibration matching (`count_matching_darks`, `calibration_health`) scans the **piggyback
library subtree** (`rig_config` sets `library_dir` -> `.../Library/piggyback`). If the
librarian is filing OSC frames under `_/OSC` instead of the piggyback subtree, calibration
won't be found even once it's shot. Check `PS_PIGGYBACK_LIBRARY_DIR` / the librarian's
per-rig routing so OSC lights **and** their darks/flats land in the same subtree. (Left as a
check, not changed — it touches live librarian routing.)

## 4. WBPP recipe (no-scripting fallback)
Scripts → Batch Processing → **WeightedBatchPreprocessing**. Same result as
`integrate_osc.js` through the GUI.

0. Run `run-integration-osc.ps1 -CullDryRun` (or `osc_cull.py` directly) first:
   WBPP cannot see split-pointing subs.
1. **Add Lights** → `C:\Users\sleep\Astrophotography\Staging\M31_OSC\LIGHTS\OSC`
   (92 frames). Leave darks/flats/bias empty for now (none match yet — WBPP just
   runs uncalibrated).
2. **CFA / OSC:** tick **"CFA images"** (top of the Lights tab). Debayer pattern =
   **Auto** (reads `BAYERPAT=RGGB`); method VNG or Bilinear.
3. **Weighting (keep soft subs, weight down):** Image Weighting = **PSF Signal
   Weight** (default). It keeps every sub and down-weights the low-SNR/soft ones —
   do NOT set an approval/rejection that discards frames.
4. **Registration → enable "Distortion correction"** (Star Alignment distortion
   model). This is the key setting — it removes the ~0.16°/night field rotation
   that left star tails in the quick-look.
5. **Local Normalization:** ON (helps the uncalibrated gradients).
6. **Integration → Pixel Rejection:** Winsorized Sigma Clipping (WBPP auto-picks it
   for ~90 frames). Reference frame: let WBPP auto-select the best-weighted.
7. Set the output directory → **Run**. Master lands in `<output>/master/`.

Uncalibrated, so finish with **DynamicBackgroundExtraction / GradientCorrection**
(vignetting + light pollution) then stretch. Once OSC darks/flats/bias are banked
(§2), drop them into the same WBPP and it auto-calibrates before debayer.
