# OSC (one-shot-color) integration — pipeline + calibration

Covers the 600 mm piggyback rig (AP26CC, IMX571 RGGB, 1.29"/px). Companion to the
mono RC16 SHO pipeline. Light epoch: **120 s, gain 100, offset 256, 0 °C**.

## 1. PixInsight pipeline (clean stars)
Files in `deploy/`:
- `integrate_osc.js` — PJSR: (bias/dark/flat if staged) -> ImageCalibration ->
  CosmeticCorrection (CFA) -> Debayer RGGB (VNG) -> **SubframeSelector** (writes an
  `SSWEIGHT` per sub from FWHM + eccentricity + SNR; **keeps every sub, weights the
  soft ones down** instead of rejecting) -> **StarAlignment with
  `distortionCorrection = true`** (the fix for the field's ~0.16°/night rotation that
  a rigid transform can't remove) -> weighted `ImageIntegration` (WinsorizedSigmaClip)
  -> `masterOSC.xisf` + `masterOSC_review.jpg`.
- `prepare-integration-osc.ps1` — stage OSC lights + `INSTRUME=AP26CC`, epoch-matched
  calibration into `Staging/<name>/{LIGHTS/OSC,DARKS,BIAS,FLATS/OSC}`.
- `run-integration-osc.ps1` — fill the staging path into the script and launch PixInsight.

Run on the desktop:
```
.\deploy\prepare-integration-osc.ps1 -Name "M31_OSC"
.\deploy\run-integration-osc.ps1     -Name "M31_OSC"
```
It runs **uncalibrated** if no OSC masters are staged (still debayers, distortion-registers,
and integrates) — so you get clean stars now, and full calibration once the frames below exist.

## 2. Calibration capture — already built into the sequencer
No new code needed; the machinery matches the light epoch via `rig_config(PIGGYBACK)`
(gain 100 / offset 256 / 0 °C / `dark_exposures="120"`). Three ways to get it:

- **Automatically on arm** — `_dispatch_piggyback_companion` (armer.py) sends NINA #2 a
  companion that shoots OSC **dawn flats always**, and roof-closed **darks + a bias top-up
  when NINA #2 can see the shared safety monitor**. Requires `PS_PIGGYBACK_ENABLED` and
  `PS_PIGGYBACK_CALIBRATE_ON_ARM`. If NINA #2 doesn't have the safety monitor in its
  profile, it's **dawn-flats-only** — add the shared safety monitor to the NINA #2 profile
  to unlock roof-closed darks/bias.
- **On demand (any closed-roof night)** — dispatch a matched OSC dark/bias set to NINA #2:
  ```
  POST /api/calibration/capture   {"rig":"piggyback"}          # 120 s x quota + 50 bias
  POST /api/calibration/capture   {"rig":"piggyback","darks":[[120,30]],"bias":50}
  ```
- **Flats on demand** — `POST /api/calibration/flats {"rig":"piggyback"}` (dusk) / the
  companion's dawn set. OSC flats need no filter wheel (`_osc_sky_flat`).

What you need banked (per the light epoch):
- **Darks:** 120 s, gain 100, offset 256, 0 °C — ~20–30.
- **Flats:** through the 600 mm with the AP26CC, RGGB, ~50 % ADU — ~20–30.
- **Bias** (or flat-darks): gain 100, offset 256, 0 °C — ~50.

`GET /api/calibration/health?rig=piggyback` reports what's banked and staleness.

## 3. One thing to verify (why no OSC calibration matched yet)
The M31 lights currently sit in `Library/_/OSC/` (target folder `_`), but the piggyback
calibration matching (`count_matching_darks`, `calibration_health`) scans the **piggyback
library subtree** (`rig_config` sets `library_dir` -> `.../Library/piggyback`). If the
librarian is filing OSC frames under `_/OSC` instead of the piggyback subtree, calibration
won't be found even once it's shot. Check `PS_PIGGYBACK_LIBRARY_DIR` / the librarian's
per-rig routing so OSC lights **and** their darks/flats land in the same subtree. (Left as a
check, not changed — it touches live librarian routing.)
